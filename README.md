This is a Python3 template for https://lightningbot.tk/.
The lightningbot documentation is at https://lightningbot.tk/doc.

To launch the project, execute :
```make run```

You can also use
```make run 2```
to run 2 bots at the same time, or, heck,
```make run 14```
to run 14 bots, if that's your thing.

Just fill in the move method in the MyBot class !
