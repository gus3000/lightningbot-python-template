This is a Python3 template for https://lightningbot.tk/.
The lightningbot documentation is at https://lightningbot.tk/doc.

To launch the project, execute :
```./run.sh``` or ```python3 -m mybot```

You can also use
```./run.sh 2```
to run 2 bots at the same time, or, heck,
```./run.sh 14```
to run 14 bots, if that's your thing.

Just fill in the move method in the MyBot class !
